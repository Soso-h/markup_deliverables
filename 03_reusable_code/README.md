# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

## Deliverable 5: R-package

1. the link to my developer repository of my created pRcentage R-package: https://github.com/Soso-h/pRcentage
2. **IMPORTANT**: there is no DOI to my R package website. When trying to create the doi on Zenodo the release on Zenodo failed. The error seem to be with Zonedos storage system.
--> you can see that I made a successful release on my [pRcentage repository](https://github.com/Soso-h/pRcentage). The issue is with linking it to a doi.

**note**: I nevertheless created a citation file and added it to my repo (just wihtout a doi).


ERROR on Zenodo:
