# My Reproducible Markup Manuscript

## Deliverable 3

To submit as my third deliverable for this course, this project aims to reproduce and adapt the simulation study from the paper 
**"[Introduction to Statistical Simulations in Health Research](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/12/e039921#T2)"** 
by Boulesteix et al. (2020). 


## Purpose/Background

The goal of this project is to show my skills in producing a fully reproducible 
markup manuscript as part of a reproducible research compendium. If someone were 
to clone this repository, they should be able to run the .qmd file and generate 
the final PDF without errors.


## Contents

The project is structured as follows:

-   **data/**: Contains the data sets necesary for the simulation study
-   **results/**: Outputs including the plots and the final .pdf file of the rendered manuscript
-   **documents/**: Documentation files, including the .csl and refernces

## Installation/Usage Instructions

To replicate this project on your local system:

1. Clone this repository using:
    ```bash
    git clone https://
    ```

2. Open the R. project in RStudio.

3. Run the Quarto (`.qmd`) manuscript file to compile the pdf document, 
including the simulation and results.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following R packages:

- Hmisc
- mice
- tidyverse
- broom
- knitr
- dplyr
- kableExtra
