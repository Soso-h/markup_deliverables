# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics (202000010)

**disclaimer**: links to my own R package created for deliverable 5 can be found in the folder: [03_reusable code](https://github.com/Soso-h/markup_deliverables/tree/dev/03_reusable_code)


## Week 6: R package

1. the link to my developer repository of my roundR R-package as created in class: https://github.com/Soso-h/roundR
2. **IMPORTANT**: there is no DOI to my R package website. When trying to create the doi on Zenodo the release on Zenodo failed. I tried it 6 times over mutiple hours. The error seem to be with Zonedos storage system.
--> you can see that I made 6 different releases on my roundR repository and they were all sucessfull. The issue is with linking it to a doi.

**note**: I nevertheless created a citation file and added it to my repo (just wihtout a doi).


ERROR on Zonedo:
{
    "error_id": "ce5d31467d9b4eeca9a091d7dd0682a0",
    "errors": "XRootD error instantiating file (root://eosmedia.cern.ch//eos/media/zenodo/prod/data/2a/65/7027-40ce-4e28-b5ad-60bec55b45f2/data?eos.bookingsize=104857600) file: [ERROR] Server responded with an error: [3021] Unable to get quota space - quota not defined or exhausted /eos/media/zenodo/prod/data/2a/65/7027-40ce-4e28-b5ad-60bec55b45f2/data; Disk quota exceeded"
