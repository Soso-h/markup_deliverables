## My Favourtie Equation

The solutions of a quadratic equation can be expressed using the p-q-formula: $$\frac{-p}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^2 - q}$$

### The Story Behind it

I will never forget this formula because my math teacher played [this German song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRblwTsX6hQ) to us in 7th grade, and the melody stuck, meaning I will always know how to solve a quadratic equation.
