  abstract = {Our goal has been to demonstrate several ways in which psychological jurisprudence can inform a set of legal questions, especially those pertaining to the legitimate exercise of legal authority and the motivation of individuals and groups to adhere to the tenets of the legal system. We have considered a specific set of theoretical and empirical developments in social psychology that we think are broadly relevant to several areas of the law. These developments pertain to human motivation, social influence, procedural fairness, and system legitimacy and the relations among these constructs. More specifically, we have suggested that the deterrence model makes a number of assumptions concerning human motivation to comply with the law and that at least some of these assumptions are untenable. A more realistic model takes as its starting point the notion that people are intrinsically motivated to follow internalized moral values that are supportive of a system that is perceived as legitimate. Because perceptions of legitimacy can be inaccurate due to a number of system-justifying biases, a legal system that delivers substantive justice (and not just the appearance of justice) must be based on something other than consensus. We have suggested that one of the most solid foundations for such a system is a genuine commitment to normative standards of procedural fairness. This formulation suggests a number of consequences for reactions to rule breakers, restorative sentencing, and corporate malfeasance. Our hope is that by taking seriously both subjective (i.e., social and psychological) and objective (i.e., normative) factors with regard to justice and the law--as well as the relationship between subjective and objective factors--it is possible to develop a more sophisticated understanding of how citizens in a society like ours can be motivated to follow norms for appropriate conduct and, indeed, why they should.
