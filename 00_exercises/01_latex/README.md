# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics (202000010).


Exercise 1 
Overview
This repository contains the solution for Exercise 1.6 in the Markup class, which involved creating and modifying LaTeX documents, generating figures and tables using R, and using LaTeXdiff to compare the original and modified versions of the document.

Contents:
doc1_SHetche.pdf: The original document containing:

A title page
An equation
A section and a subsection
Figures and tables generated by R code (including histogram, density plot, strip plot, and box plot)
AI-generated fairytale text

doc2_SHetche.pdf: The modified document where the fairytale text has been slightly altered.

diff_SHetche.pdf: The LaTeXdiff file that shows the differences between doc1_SHetche.pdf and doc2_SHetche.pdf.

How to Reproduce:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have R installed along with the necessary packages (lattice and xtable).
Compile the LaTeX files using your preferred LaTeX editor.
Run the R code to generate the figures and tables, and include them in the LaTeX document.
Use LaTeXdiff to compare the two documents and generate the diff file.
